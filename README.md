# Kaltura Information Extension

Kaltura Information is a Chrome extension that displays info about Kaltura media players in a page. This extension is meant to be used within Canvas by Instructure to find the Entry ID's of embedded Kaltura Media. Finding the id manually can be a somewhat tedious process. This product was created to simplify the process of getting this id for those who need it.
